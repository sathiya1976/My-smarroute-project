SmartRouteAI – Intelligent Shipping Route Optimization
# 🚢 SmartRouteAI – Intelligent Shipping Route Optimization

SmartRouteAI is an AI-powered solution designed to help shipping lines and freight forwarders suggest the most optimized, cost-effective, and sustainable routes for cargo movement. It analyzes multiple parameters including cost, transit time, reliability, carbon footprint, and operational constraints to recommend the best-fit route for each shipment.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

In today’s global logistics environment, customers often face multiple shipping options without clear insight into which route truly balances time, cost, and reliability. The decision-making process is often manual, inconsistent, and based on static schedules or partial data, resulting in inefficiencies and suboptimal service.

---

## ✅ Solution Overview

SmartRouteAI addresses this gap by offering:

- **AI-driven route suggestions** based on historical and real-time data  
- **Optimization across multiple criteria** like cost, speed, reliability, and emissions  
- **Transparent and explainable recommendations** for internal and external users  
- A scalable prototype that logistics providers can integrate into customer service or booking platforms

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🔢 Data Sources:
- Historical shipment data (routes, transit times, costs, exceptions)
- Carrier schedules and reliability data
- Port congestion and operational constraints
- Real-time vessel tracking
- Customer preferences and constraints
- Emission and sustainability metrics

### 🧠 AI Techniques:
- Machine learning (predictive ETA, cost modeling)
- Optimization algorithms (multi-criteria decision making)
- Natural language processing (parsing customer instructions)
- Reinforcement learning (improving suggestions over time)
- Scenario simulation (disruption management)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `PuLP` or `Google OR-Tools` (optimization)
  - Optional: `NLTK`, `spaCy`, `OpenRouteService`, `VesselFinder API`
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebooks / VSCode
  - Git / GitHub for version control
